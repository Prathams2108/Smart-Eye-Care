# Smart Eye Care

## Details
Smart Eye Care is a Web based ML application that is capable of analysing the images uploaded by the user and detecting if any disease is present. This is my final year MCA project, the system is capable of detecting Glaucoma, Keratoconus and Corneal Ulcer. CNN models are used for this purpose. The dataset used for training the glaucoma detection model was a combination o three datasets: Drishti-GS1, Rim-One and Acrima, the dataset for training the Keratoconus which includes 150 cases for Keratoconus and 150 cases for Normal, each case has 7 images. The dataset for corneal ulcer detection contained 712 stained images of human eye. The datasets are availble publicly on kaggle.
